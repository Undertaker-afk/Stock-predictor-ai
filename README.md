## Using for Structured Products

### Initial Screening
1. Use extended lookback period (up to 10 years) for long-term performance analysis
2. Look for stocks with stable volatility and good risk-adjusted returns
3. Check liquidity scores for trading feasibility

### Risk Assessment
1. Review risk metrics to match client risk profile
2. Analyze maximum drawdowns for worst-case scenarios
3. Compare risk-adjusted returns using Sharpe and Sortino ratios

### Product Structuring
1. Use prediction horizon (up to 1 year) for product maturity design
2. Consider dividend yields for income-generating products
3. Use sector analysis for proper diversification

### Portfolio Construction
1. Analyze multiple stocks for diversified bundles
2. Use sector metrics to avoid overexposure
3. Consider market cap rankings for appropriate sizing

## Prediction Strategies

### Chronos Strategy
Uses Amazon's Chronos model for ML-based price prediction. This strategy:
- Analyzes historical price patterns
- Generates probabilistic forecasts
- Provides confidence intervals

### Technical Strategy
Uses traditional technical analysis indicators to generate predictions:
- RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
- MACD for trend direction
- Bollinger Bands for volatility
- Moving Averages for trend confirmation

## Trading Signals

The demo provides trading signals based on multiple technical indicators:
- RSI: Oversold (<30), Overbought (>70), Neutral
- MACD: Buy (MACD > Signal), Sell (MACD < Signal)
- Bollinger Bands: Buy (price < lower band), Sell (price > upper band)
- SMA: Buy (20-day > 50-day), Sell (20-day < 50-day)

An overall trading signal is calculated by combining all individual signals.

## Practical Example: Creating a 6-Month 8% Yield Structured Product

### Scenario
A bank needs to create a structured product that offers an 8% yield over 6 months while maintaining profitability for the institution.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Initial Stock Screening**
   - Use the application to analyze stocks with:
     - High liquidity (for easy hedging)
     - Stable volatility (for predictable risk)
     - Strong technical indicators
     - Positive long-term trends
   - Recommended stocks: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL (high liquidity, stable volatility)

2. **Product Structure Design**
   - Use the 6-month prediction horizon
   - Analyze historical volatility for barrier setting
   - Set participation rate based on risk metrics
   - Structure: Reverse Convertible with 8% coupon

3. **Risk Analysis**
   - Use the application's risk metrics:
     - Check maximum drawdown (should be < 15% for 6 months)
     - Verify liquidity scores (should be > 80%)
     - Analyze Sharpe ratio (should be > 1.5)

4. **Business Case Example**

   **Product Parameters:**
   - Notional Amount: $1,000,000
   - Term: 6 months
   - Coupon: 8% p.a. (4% for 6 months)
   - Underlying: AAPL
   - Barrier: 85% of initial price
   - Participation: 100%

   **Revenue Structure:**
   - Client receives: 8% p.a. (4% for 6 months)
   - Bank's hedging cost: ~5% p.a.
   - Bank's profit margin: ~3% p.a.
   - Total client payout: $40,000 (4% of $1M)
   - Bank's profit: $15,000 (1.5% of $1M)

5. **Implementation Steps**
   - Use the application's extended prediction horizon (180 days)
   - Set technical indicators to monitor barrier risk
   - Implement dynamic delta hedging based on predictions
   - Monitor risk metrics daily using the application

6. **Risk Management**
   - Use the application's volatility predictions for dynamic hedging
   - Monitor technical indicators for early warning signals
   - Set up automated alerts for barrier proximity
   - Regular rebalancing based on prediction updates

### Key Success Factors
- Regular monitoring of prediction accuracy
- Dynamic adjustment of hedging strategy
- Clear communication of product risks to clients
- Proper documentation of all assumptions and methodologies

This example demonstrates how the application can be used to create profitable structured products while managing risk effectively. The bank can use this framework to create similar products with different underlying assets, terms, and yield targets.
