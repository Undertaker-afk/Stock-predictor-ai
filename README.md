## Prediction Strategies

### Chronos Strategy
Uses Amazon's Chronos model for ML-based price prediction. This strategy:
- Analyzes historical price patterns
- Generates probabilistic forecasts
- Provides confidence intervals

### Technical Strategy
Uses traditional technical analysis indicators to generate predictions:
- RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
- MACD for trend direction
- Bollinger Bands for volatility
- Moving Averages for trend confirmation

## Trading Signals

The demo provides trading signals based on multiple technical indicators:
- RSI: Oversold (<30), Overbought (>70), Neutral
- MACD: Buy (MACD > Signal), Sell (MACD < Signal)
- Bollinger Bands: Buy (price < lower band), Sell (price > upper band)
- SMA: Buy (20-day > 50-day), Sell (20-day < 50-day)

An overall trading signal is calculated by combining all individual signals.
